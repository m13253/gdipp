gdipp README
====================

The gdipp project is the relaunch of the suspended gdi++.dll  project. Like the InkStone project, we found the source code of gdi++.dll project is too complex to manage, and decide to start over a new code base. The goal of gdipp project is to continue the development of gdi++, expand its functionality, improve its performance, provide better compatibility for the current and future Windows versions (potentially at the cost of removing compatibility for old Windows), create detailed and formal documentation, as well as tools to help using it.

Under the installed directory, the following files are contained (depend on the chosen load mode, some files may not be installed). Here is some brief descriptions of each:

  * gdimm_xx.dll. The main component of the gdipp project, comparative of gdi++.dll. Most of the font management, text rendering and API simulating is taken place here. gdimm means gdi-- for emphasizing its design idea of simplicity comparing to gdi++.dll.

  * gdipp_svc_xx.exe: installed as a Windows service. It monitors process creation and automatically inject gdimm.dll. Stopping the service also unloads gdimm.dll, and revert to Windows default. It can be set to start with system via services.msc. The display name of the service is "gdipp Service".

  * gdipp_loader_xx.exe: accept an executable file path as argument and run it, comparative of gdi++.exe. If the process is successfully spawned, inject gdimm.dll to the running process, and the new process will render text with gdimm.dll instantly.

  * gdipp_demo_xx.exe: a demo to illustrate and debug the gdimm.dll. It loads the gdimm.dll and use the gdimm text out functions to render benchmark text. If no gdimm.dll is found in the current directory, it uses the original Windows APIs.

Detailed description of setting.xml is placed in the SETTING file.
